Another hello-world toturial, oh joy.

Hello, wakiza here. I'm attempting to learn Python on my own. (If you don't count the internets and or it's denizens, that is.) Upon further evaluation I think this may be the blog place/format of choice for me. It will allow me to make concise changes and updates to my learning history. Hooray! Hubot is right about them moon tacos trumping the earth ones tho.
